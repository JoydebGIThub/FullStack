Java is a programming language which has been around seemingly forever. The reson for this is:
- It is a mature language
- has a wide range of features, and is constantly being updated
- It can be use in any feild from `big data and machine learing` to `web and mobile app` development

## How Java works
### What is a Programming Language?
A programming language provides us a means to write a `set of instructions` in order to `carry out a task`. Just as we as humans use any language to communicate and also to give instructions to one another, a programming language provides us with the tools which we need to give `instructions` to a machine.
A programming language can be through of as a formal language, which has its own vocabulary as well as syntax. It not just the words, but also how we arrange them in order to form a complete instruction
We have words that is a `vocabulary` as well as `syntax` in order to `convey instructions`, and all of these instructions put together can be used to implement algorithms.

### What is Java?
An Object-oriented, class-based programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
**Object-oriented**: Each entity is an `object` containing fields and methods.
- Fields (also called attributes or properties) describe an object
  - e.g., name or date of birth of an insurance company customer
 
- Methods (or function) enable operations using objects
  - e.g., a method to calculate the customer's premium
 
- Typically, an object's own methods access and modify its fields
In an object-oriented language an entity such as a customer of an insurance company can be defined by means of an object and an object is essentially a combination of fields which describe that object and methods or functions which allow operations on the object.
Most object-oriented language are `class-based`. Different types of entites are defined by means of something called class.
**class-based**: It is a specific type of object-oriented programming language and this uses a construct classed classed in order to define a sets or objects.
- A class is a `generic` definition of an entity while an object is an instance of that entity
  - A class define what fields and methods are required for a customer
  - Objects represent specific customers (Joy, Deb, etc)
 
- Classes enable the `encapsulation` of associated fields and methods. The benefits of using class based approach is that they allow us to `wrap up` a number of fields as well as methods associated with a type of object into a single unit
- classes may permit inheritance

**few implementation dependencies**: Java is ment to be `platform independent`. We should able to write java program and it should run on any operating system. We don't wirte different code for separate system.
To run the single code on different OS system we use `Java Virtual Machine`. Program don't run on the OS, but in the `JVM`. JVM will talk to the OS.
The **Oracle Corporation**, which is a company which maintains the Java Programming language has built JVMs for most commonly used platforms.
