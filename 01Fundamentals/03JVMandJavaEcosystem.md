## The JVM and the Java Ecosystem
Because the fact that it is the Java virtual machine or JVM which allows Java programs to run in a platform independent manner we will now zoom in on the workings of the JVM in order to get a better understanding of how we can build and then run Java programs in the previous video we saw that in order to run a Java program there are in fact a number of different layers which come into the picture we write the program in the form of a Java file eventually that gets executed on a Java virtual machine and that ensures that our program is able to communicate with the IT with the underlying operating system which in turn ensures that the program can run on the hardware so of course there are many different layers here but we will now in fact focus on this particular translation from a Java program to something which gets executed on the JVM and for that well there is a new set of transformations which we can examine as touched upon earlier when we write a Java program we save it down as a file with a dot Java extension that file cannot be executed directly by the Java virtual machine and instead it is first fed into a Java compiler it is the compiler which takes in the Java file and then produces as an output a dot class file this process of converting a Java file into a class file is termed as compiling a Java program and this phase is also commonly referred to as the build phase or building of a program or application this dot class file is 1 which contains Java bytecode and it is that byte code which is capable of running inside a Java virtual machine while you need not concern yourself with this transformation on a day-to-day basis when coding Java programs it is important for you to recognize that to get programs to run there are in fact a number of different transformations which take place under the hood so while we now have an understanding of the translations required in order to run a Java program well let's take a closer look at the JVM itself we already know that this is what is capable of running Java bytecode however in our discussion so far we have only covered the fact that it is a program written in the Java programming language which can be compiled into Java bytecode using a Java compiler however this is only part of the picture there are in fact a number of different programming languages which can be compiled into executable bytecode for example on Java there is also groovy which is a scripting language scala which is often used in big data and the language kotlin which is the recommended language for Android development all of these and a handful of other languages as well eventually compiled into Java bytecode and can be run on a Java virtual machine all of these languages are in fact quite similar to Java in terms of syntax and features and if you know Java then learning any of these other languages is very simple another significant feature of the Java virtual machine of course is that it ensures interoperability that program that is a program can execute on a variety of platforms in fact for any platform for which there is a JVM available let's move along then from the Java virtual machine to the broader Java ecosystem when looking at any documentation related to Java online you are likely to come across many different terms and this can be rather confusing and it's better for us to understand the different components involved in the Java ecosystem of course we are already familiar with the JVM which runs Java bytecode but beyond that there is also something called the Java runtime environment this is in fact a superset of the JVM a Java runtime environment or JRE includes a JVM a few Java libraries which are in fact a collection of Java classes and methods which are very useful in performing some basic operations for example there is a math library which includes built-in functions which allow us to perform basic math operations such as calculating square root calculating the log of a number and so on so any machine with a Java runtime environment can run Java programs however if you are a developer of Java applications you will require the Java development kit you can think of this as a superset of the GID so the GI allows us to run Java programs but in order for us to write them and then produce bytecode which can then be run we will require a Java compiler as well so the JDK includes that but in order to help with the development or writing of Java program there are a variety of other tools which are also part of the JDK package this includes A debugger which allows us to get to the source of any errors in our Java programs by allowing us to run them one step at a time so now that we have an idea of the JVM and the Java ecosystem in the next video we'll take a closer look at some of the other significant properties of the Java language
